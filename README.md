# Ball and Beam Module LASE II

**Author:** Hadler Henrique Tempesta\
**Orientation:** Dr. Juliano Coelho Miranda\
**Co-orientation:** Ms. Daniel Soares de Alcântara

***The ball and beam module LASE II was developed to be used as a didatic tool for teaching control theory at technical education.***

The control theory has great importance to the engineer and cience branches; however, it may be difficulty fully absorve such techniques without proper mathematics background, and
a way  to see the results in practice. Given these reasons, the module was developed, its purpose is to help teaches and students to more easily abstract the studied techniques of control.

The mechanical structure of the module was 3D model and then 3D printed; it has fitting parts that allow the user to assemble it the most suitable way. All the parts were made available, this way they can be downloaded and 3D printed to anyone interrested.

One way of assembling the pieces will form a module such as shown below:\

The project also received a base code developed to be used on a Arduino UNO, it is also availabe to download.

**Developed in:** Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica de Minas Gerais, CEFET-MG. Varginha, Minas Gerais, Brazil.
